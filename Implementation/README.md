# File explanation:  

* `background.m`: the class definition file for background.
* `basicStructure.m`: provides basic idea of implementing keyboard interaction in MatLab. 
* `bullet.m`: the class definition file for single bullet, including bullet coordinates and direction.
* `bullets.m`: the class definition file for all bullets - a collection of object instance `bullet`.
* `experiment.m`: just like the name, it is a temporary file providing experimental implementation, with no actual usage. 
* `tank.m`: the class definition file for tank. Decides how tank interact with the environment, also has the hard-coded AI algorithm. 
* `tankGame.m`: main game file. Run this file to start the game. 

# Current goal of game implementation  

1. Starting and ending animation
2. A better Computer opponent algorithm 
3. Killing streak and appearance improvement
